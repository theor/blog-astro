I always loved procedural generation, and was really impressed by [mewo2's fantasy maps](https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/). I decided to give it a try using Unity and the [Burst Compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@0.2/manual/index.html), an amazing piece of tech developed at Unity. It was also the opportunity to dig into SVG and implement a few algorithms and white papers: Delaunay's triangulation, a depression filling algorithm, a cartographic labeling algorithm based on simulated annealing, water network computation and a few others. I'll write a (probably long) series of articles detailing the interesting parts and algorithms of the project and my general process to approach this kind of topic.

I could have used [Unity's ECS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/manual/index.html), but it seemed a bit overkill. However I'll use the [job system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html) directly with Burst, and render just enough 3d to visualize the generated terrain. The map itself will be an SVG file written on disk.

The steps will be

- Generate random points
- Write a custom Burst-compatible data structure to store polygons and generate a Delaunay triangulation using [Bowyer-Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm)
- Assign a height to each polygon
- Fill the depressions using [Planchon-Darboux](https://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers20-05/010031925.pdf)
- Clean the coastlines
- Compute the water flow over the map by following down slopes
- Create water sources and follow the water network until it reaches the sea
- Render all of that to SVG (which itself will require many more steps)

Burst-compatible code must satisfy multiple constraints:

- No reference types or classes
- which means no boxing of a struct to an interface type
- struct instance methods and static methods only
- no managed collections, only [Native Containers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystemNativeContainer.html)

So Burst strongly favors data-oriented design/programming. I'll refer you to [this list of resources about DOD and Mike Acton's talks](https://dataorientedprogramming.wordpress.com/tag/mike-acton/) if you want to know more about it.

So let's start by [a bit of boilerplate and generating points](../part1.md).
