I've heard a lot about classic Doom's data format and decided to write some Rust code to extract its maps and convert that to vector graphics I could laser cut. 

I'll go through the process, from the data extraction to the geometry reconstruction to outputting laser-cuttable SVGs, including the geometrical dead end I enthusiastically ran to when I tried to preview the result using [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

# DOOM WAD format

DOOM's data was designed with modding as a goal : the entire game is an executable and a `.WAD` data pack. The shareware/demo version shipped with DOOM1.WAD, which is still available freely.

<Video caption="Doom WAD format, illustrated with MotionCanvas" width="100%" height="auto" src={import("./wad.mp4")}/>

The WAD format is well documented - see the [Unofficial DOOM spec](https://www.gamers.org/dhs/helpdocs/dmsp1666.html) or the [ZDoom wiki](https://zdoom.org/wiki/WAD). The gist of it is :
- the WAD file starts with a header follow by the actual data, ends with directory entries describing that data
- the header contains a pointer to the first directory entry and the entry count
- each directory entry contains a pointer to the data and its size

I'll skip some (fascinating!) details, as the [DOOM game engine black book](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/) of the wonderful Fabien Sanglard already covers all of that.

Those data items are called "lumps" in doom parlance. Some contains map geometry, others textures, sounds, text, ... everything needed for a game. 

A map is described by multiple lumps
- `VERTEXES` is a list of world positions
- `LINEDEFS` describes lines joining two segments and references one SIDEDEF per line "side"
- `SIDEDEFS` are "walls", textures for a line, and belong to a SECTOR
- `SECTORS` are polygons with a floor and ceiling height

The map data also includes a BSP tree whose leaves are subsectors, sectors split to be convex polygons, but also texture definitions compositing multiple sprites and much more.

## Implementation

I used [nom](https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom), a rust parser combinators library that can parse text and binary formats. Here is a typical usage: parsing `THINGS`, the map items/power ups:

```rust
pub struct Thing {
    pub pos_x: i16,
    pub pos_y: i16,
    pub angle: i16,
    pub thing_type: u16,
    pub flags: ThingFlags,
}

impl Lump for Thing {
    // used to determine how many items in a lump
    const SIZE: usize = 10;
}

pub fn parse_thing(input: &[u8]) -> IResult<&[u8], Thing> {
    map(
        // parse 5 unsigned shorts
        tuple((le_i16, le_i16, le_i16, le_u16, le_u16)),
        // map them to the struct fields
        |(pos_x, pos_y, angle, thing_type, flags)| Thing {
            pos_x,
            pos_y,
            angle,
            thing_type,
            flags: ThingFlags::from_bits(flags).unwrap(),
        },
    )(input)
}
```

I have a nice `parse_lump` function in a WAD struct, taking the lump name and the parsing function :
```rust
let things: Vec<Thing> = wad.parse_lump("THINGS", thing::parse_thing);
```

# Geometry

Getting line segments is relatively easy (group `linedefs` by `sidedef.sector`). However, I also intend to group sectors by similar floor heights to reduce the layer count and I need to mark edges as cut or engrave lines if they are polygon borders or internal lines. 

The parsed WAD data is an unordered collection of edges. We have a guarantee that edges won't cross. Merging polygons is just a set union, and removing internal lines is a matter of finding duplicate edges in a polygon.

Strictly speaking, this is enough to produce a SVG that can be laser cut.

# Today's rabbit hole: 3D rendering and triangulation

Things were too simple at this point, so of course I found something. It all started when I thought "wouldn't it be great if I could preview the stacked laser cut layers in 3D".

I bootstrapped a simple Bevy app. To render the layers, I need to triangulate them. It happens there's a [triangulate crate](https://crates.io/crates/triangulate), but it comes with constraints.

First, let's look at the DOOM polygons three cases:

1. a _simple_ polygon, which has a specific definition ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon)) :
    - exactly two edges meet at each vertex
    - the number of edges equals the number of vertices
<img src="./case1.webp" alt="Case 1, a simple polygon" width="30%"/>

2. one polygon with holes (called "weakly simple polygons" in the most basic case akin to a disc). This means the sector represents multiple polygons where one contains the others
<img src="./case2.webp" alt="Case 1, a simple polygon" width="30%"/>

3. multiple polygons sharing one vertex - to be accurate multiple polygons where each pair share at most _one_ contiguous vertex, which makes it a _complex_ polygon. the fact that the edges intersections are vertices means the polygon can be split into simple polygons.
<img src="./case3.webp" alt="Case 1, a simple polygon" width="30%"/>


The `triangulate` crate (and, AFAIK, all other implementations) needs actual paths - an _ordered_ list of vertices. It also does not support non-simple polygons, which excludes case 3.

To rebuild a path from the unordered list of edges, my initial approach was to pick an edge, then find any edge connected to it. this works for cases 1 and 2, but not for the last one, as those polygons have more than two edges meeting at some vertices.

<Video width="10" noloop src={import("./badtris.mp4")}/>

The solution to that problem is to rebuild paths by repeatedly finding the shortest loop from an edge, which is equivalent to finding all loops where no vertex is used more than once per loop:

<Video noloop  src={import("./goodtris.mp4")}/>

If a doom sector contains multiple loops, it means it falls either in case 2 or 3. To figure it out, we can rely on empiric assumptions :
- case 2 and 3 are exclusive - meaning if a vertex is shared, it must not be a hole. only I'm not _sure_ this is true
- it also means that if a loop contains another, it is the outer loop of a polygon with holes

I went with the latter, using the [geo rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/geo) which has extensive support for polygon operations.

I got that to work eventually:

![Sector triangulation in bevy](./triangulation.png)

The issue is that I now need to invert those polygons, as I want to subtract them to an enclosing rectangle - meaning boolean operations (also supported by `geo`), but now the triangulation fails.

## Subsector attempt

But wait, the WAD does contain simple, convex polygons, right ? The result of the binary space partitioning. It does, but those polygons sometimes have _implicit_ edges defined by the partition lines. I started working on that, then realized that was too much side-tracking. It should work however. Maybe later...

## Backtracking

I gave up on that approach at this point. The actual solution to the preview, a very valid problem, was simpler: use [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to import the svg layers, extrude them, stack them export a .glb I could render in blender. That's how I rendered the banner of this article. Note that tinkercad's SVG import do expect actual SVG paths and not disjoint lines ; so part of that work did serve to produce a cute render.
