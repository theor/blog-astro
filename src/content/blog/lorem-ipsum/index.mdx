I needed a reason to play with rust+wasm, and I have always loved the [demoscene](http://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/the-demoscene/) and its cleverness. I also wanted the result to be embeddable here on my blog made with Astro. Guess who's about to fill buffers with fire, plasma, stars and roads.

# Rust, Wasm bootstrap

The rust community has spent much time making WebAssembly a functional and efficient target, and it shows. First, the `rustc` compiler has [multiple targets](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/rust-targets.html) for it: we'll use the seemingly undecided `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. The workflow that worked for me uses [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/), which, in one command, handles the compilation using `cargo`, the wasm optimization/stripping using `wasm-opt` and generates the .js/.ts glue code.

I also discovered the lovely [cargo watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch) to monitor my rust folder and compile in on change, using this command:
```sh
cargo watch -s "wasm-pack build --profiling --target web -d blog-astro/src/content/blog/lorem-ipsum/_pkg --no-typescript --no-pack"
```

About arguments:
- I use `--profiling` to get function names when profiling in Chrome. Never used `--debug` ; I don't know if I got too much in the oldskool mindset, but I didn't even searched how to attach a debugger with WASM, or if it is even possible
- `--target web` outputs wasm ready for the browser. Didn't get `--target bundler` to work with Astro
- I did write my glue code in Typescript, but the ts typings that wasm-build outputs made Astro choke on a const with no value
- `--no-pack` prevents the generation of a `package.json` file, which IIUC is used when publishing npm packages. It also made Astro choke

The resulting .js files exports an `init` promise loading the actual wasm, and everything exported by the rust code.

Rust exports are made using `wasm-bindgen` :

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct Plasma { /* ... */ }

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl Plasma {
    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    pub fn new(w: usize, h: usize) -> Self { /* ... */ }

    pub fn update(&mut self,t: f32) { /* ... */ }
}
```


```ts
import init, { Plasma, StatefulFire, Stars, Roads2,  } from "./_pkg/sample_rust";

await init();
const p = new Plasma(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
p.update(time);
```

I added controls using [TweakPane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/), a great js lib for controls Ã  la datgui/imgui. Then it's just a matter of filling an HTML Canvas using rust code - more on that in the [Wasm interop optimization section](#todays-rabbit-hole--wasm-interop-optimization)

# Plasma effect

<Run data-sample="Plasma" />

The plasma effect is typical of demo effects: trivial to do today with a GPU, impressive when it was written on a CPU, often without a floating point unit.  Look at this Amstrad demo:

The gist of it is to compute a value for each pixel, then use it to index a palette. My attempt is inspired by [Nikos Papadopoulos and 4rknova Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tdGWX).

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct Plasma {
    w: usize,
    h: usize,
    palette: Vec<u32>,
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl Plasma {
    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    pub fn new(w: usize, h: usize) -> Self {
        let mut palette: Vec<u32> = vec![0; 256];
        for i in 0..palette.len() {
            let f = i as f32 / palette.len() as f32;
            let c = Rgb::from(Hsl::from((
                lerp(203.0..=31.0, f),
                82.0,
                ((f+0.5).powi(2)*100.0).clamp(10.0, 60.0)
            )));
            palette[i] = col32(
                c.red().min(255.0) as u8,
                c.green().min(255.0) as u8,
                c.blue().min(255.0) as u8,
            );
        }

        Self { w, h, palette }
    }

    pub fn update(&mut self, b: &mut [u32], time: f32) {

        let a = vec2(self.w as f32 / self.h as f32, 1.0);
        for y in 0..self.h {
            for x in 0..self.w {
                let fx = x as f32 / self.w as f32;
                let fy = y as f32 / self.h as f32;

                let c = vec2(fx, fy) * a * 8.0 + vec2(time * 0.3,time * 0.3);
                let k = 0.1 + (c.y + (0.148 - time).sin()).cos() + 2.4 * time;
                let w = 0.9 + (c.x + (0.628 + time).cos()).sin() - 0.7 * time;
                let d = c.length();
                let s = 7.0 * (d+w).cos() * (k+w).sin();
                let i = y * self.w + x;
                let cv = s + vec3(0.2, 0.5, 0.9);
                b[i] = col32f(cv.x,cv.y, cv.z);
                let c = self.palette[((s.cos() * 0.5 + 0.5) * 255.0) as usize % 256];
                b[i] = c;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

An indexed palette used to be a requirement - the above Amstrad CPC had at best at 16 colors palette out of 27, in Mode 0 (160x200 pixels) before using any of the typical tricks of the time. The real bottleneck, however, is the massive amount of `sin/cos` calls. I tried to implement a precomputed look-up table for the trigonometry as [we used to](https://namoseley.wordpress.com/2015/07/26/sincos-generation-using-table-lookup-and-iterpolation/) but Rust's own trig is still twice as fast.
