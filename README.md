This is the source code of my blog, made with Astro 3.0 and @astrojs/mdx.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
|   |   â””â”€ article
|   |      â”œâ”€ index.mdx
|   |      â””â”€ image.png
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Articles are self-contained in their own folder in content. They support:
- auto import of components thanks to [https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app/](https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app/) : `Box`, `Figure` and `Video` components
- a `banner` in the frontmatter (and a `staticBanner` fallback for twitter cards if the banner is a video)
- a `draft` field

The site itself has RSS, a sitemap, basic tag support.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
